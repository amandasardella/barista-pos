# ‚òï Coffee Order Tracker

## Description

**Coffee Order Tracker** is a full-stack POS (Point of Sale) application designed to modernize and streamline the coffee order system in the workplace.
Inspired by my real experience as a **Barista Supervisor**, this project replaces manual order tracking with a digital solution to improve **speed**, **accuracy**, and **inventory management**.
The system allows baristas to **register**, **view**, and **analyze** beverage orders efficiently ‚Äî saving time and enhancing workflow accuracy.
This project demonstrates practical experience in **designing**, **developing**, and **deploying** real-world software using modern web technologies.
